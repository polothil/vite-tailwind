            We at Cirkul√§ra Verkstaden offer the bicycle service that comes to you. After
            many years of experience in the bicycle industry, we now offer a rolling
            workshop that comes exactly where you need it. We work climate-smart, close to
            the customer and based on the customer's own wishes regarding time and place.
            Having a broken bike should not be a project, instead let us come and repair
            the bike!

          <p className='text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6'>
            We start from Kortedala and Gamlestaden in Gothenburg and contact you to agree
            on a time and place as soon as a repair request has been submitted via the
            form on the page. You can also contact us with questions by phone.
